                <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
                JATAN was born from the idea of Individual Social Responsibility (ISR), first explored by a group of management students at BIMTECH, Noida, during their CSR lessons. Inspired by the belief that meaningful change begins with personal effort, they transformed a classroom thought into real-world action.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                On 1st September 2008, JATAN's Nagpur chapter was founded, with generous support from Mr. Milan Agnihotri in memory of his grandmother. The initiative was encouraged at its inception by Dr. H. Chaturvedi, Director of BIMTECH, whose words helped spark the journey.

Today, JATAN continues to stand for "the effort" â€” empowering underprivileged women and children through education, life skills, and community-led change.
